# XCL God Player Experience

This is a 3rd person experience.  The player is effectively a god.

God Players are purely spiritual and have no physical representation in the world.  They:

- can never be harmed or killed
- are not constrained by world physics

The God Player Experience Concept is the gods are in Top Down mode observing and interacting
with the world through their influence on AI Pawns.
