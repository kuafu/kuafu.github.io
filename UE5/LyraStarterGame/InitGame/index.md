# Game Initialization

The GameMode initializes when a World is loaded.
The [World Settings](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#LyraWorldSettings)
defines the [GameMode](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#LyraGameMode) to use
and (in [Lyra](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/))
which [Lyra Experience](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/)
to load by default.

There are different ways a World can come to be loaded,
including clicking the "Play In Editor" (PIE) button.

As discussed in more detail in
[Lyra Experience](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/),
unlike other Games, in Lyra you must ensure to
**delay all game play** until
`OnExperienceLoaded`, perhaps long after `BeginPlay`.


# World Load Procedure

World Loading follows this procedure:

- [Initialize Components of all World Actors](#InitializeActorsForPlay)
  - [Init Game Mode](#InitGame)
  - [Initialize Components](#InitializeComponents) *(random Actor order)*
  - [Player Login](#PlayerLogin)
    - Create Player Controller & Player State
- [World Begin Play](#BeginPlay)
  - Begin Play on all World Actors *(random Actor order)*
- [Load Lyra Experience](#LoadLyraExperience)
  - [`OnExperienceLoaded`](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#OnExperienceLoaded)
    signals that game play can begin


<a id='InitializeActorsForPlay'></a>
## Initialize Components of all World Actors

This is implemented by WorldðŸ¡’InitializeActorsForPlay


<a id='InitGame'></a>
### Init Game Mode

- GameModeðŸ¡’InitGame


<a id='InitializeComponents'></a>
### Initialize Components

Initialization of World Actors is in **RANDOM ORDER**.

When the GameMode is initialized, it does:

- GameModeðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
  - GameStateðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
  - GameStateðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents
  - GameModeðŸ¡’InitGameState
- GameModeðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents


<a id='PlayerLogin'></a>
### Player Login

- GameModeðŸ¡’Login
  - GameModeðŸ¡’SpawnPlayerController
    - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
    - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents
      - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’InitPlayerState
        - PlayerStateðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
        - PlayerStateðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents
          - GameStateðŸ¡’AddPlayerState
        - PlayerController->OnPlayerStateChanged
      - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’AddCheats
  - GameModeðŸ¡’InitNewPlayer
- PlayerControllerðŸ¡’SetPlayer
  - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’SetupInputComponent
  - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’ReceivedPlayer
    - `CommonGame` adds root HUD layout
- GameModeðŸ¡’OnPostLogin


<a id='BeginPlay'></a>
## World BeginPlay

- All World Subsystems `OnWorldBeginPlay`
- GameModeðŸ¡’StartPlay
  - GameStateðŸ¡’HandleBeginPlay
    - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’PushInputComponent
    - All World Actors BeginPlay (**RANDOM ORDER**)
      - GameModeðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - GameStateðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - PlayerStateðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - ... etc ...


<a id='LoadLyraExperience'></a>
## Load Lyra Experience

In PIE, the World's Default Lyra Experience gets loaded on the tick after GameModeðŸ¡’InitGame.

In Game, the appropriate Lyra Experience is loaded by
the Frontend State Component (or your similar Game State Component).


### Experience Load Procedure

- Load Experience Asset and its References
- Load all GameFeature Plugin (GFP) dependencies
- Activate GFPs (execute GameFeature Actions)
- Broadcast [`OnExperienceLoaded`](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#OnExperienceLoaded)

[Experience Loading Procedure](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#ExperienceLoadingProcedure)
