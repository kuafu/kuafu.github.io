# Common UI Plugin

The Common UI plugin allows the automation of a lot of platform-specific behavior in the UI.
For example, buttons can be automatically shown/hidden depending on the platform
type, and it is very easy to test different platforms in the Editor.

[Lyra Input Overview](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Input/) gives a good big picture look
at a possible way Common UI can be implemented.

## Key Concepts

- [Common UI Action Router](./ActionRouter)
  - Manages the Input Mode
- [Activatable Widget](./ActivatableWidget)
  - Base for most Lyra widgets


## Example Usage in Lyra

- [Lyra UI Policy](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Input/UIPolicy) defines a prioritized, tagged layers of
  [Activatable Widgets](./ActivatableWidget)


### Example: Lyra Common UI Layers

In ascending priority, Lyra defines these Common UI Layers as stacks with associated Gameplay Tags:

- `UI.Layer.Game` - UI relating directly to gameplay
- `UI.Layer.GameMenu` - For example: Inventory UI
- `UI.Layer.Menu` - Main Menu layer
- `UI.Layer.Modal` - Prompt/Confirmation Dialog layer


## Input Handling

Input is directed by Common UI to the Widget that currently has focus
(by default the one at the top of the highest priority visible layer)
at any given time.

Widget inputs are configured via:

- `DataTable` with row type `CommonInputActionDataBase`
- One or more `CommonInputBaseControllerData`-derived `ControllerData` assets
  - These reference the input action `DataTable`
- Custom `CommonUIInputData`-derived BP/Object
  - This references the input action `DataTable`
  - Configures Universal Input Actions, like:
    - Continue
    - Back/Cancel
    - possibly others


### Project Settings: Common Input

- Assign your custom `CommonUIInputData` object to `Input`.`Input Data` dropdown
- Configure Platform & Input Device Settings as needed
  - Windows
    - MKB
    - Gamepad
  - Etc


#### Resources to Better Understand Input & Project Setup for Common UI

- [Epic's Official Common UI Quickstart Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-quickstart-guide-for-unreal-engine/) (text + screenshot doc)
- Volkiller Games: [Common UI Input system in Unreal Engine 5](https://youtu.be/q05jmFyeb0c) (5 minute video)
- Epic's Inside Unreal episode: [Introduction to CommonUI](./Annotations/EpicGames-Introduction-to-CommonUI) (2.5 hour video)


## Shared Style Assets

Common UI allows you to create style assets that are then easily applied to widgets,
buttons, etc.

In this way you only need to update the one style and all widgets in the game will be
updated based on that style change.

To accomplish this, derive from the base style classes as needed and configure your
widgets to use the appropriate style.

### Base Style C++ Classes:
- `CommonBorderStyle`
- `CommonButtonStyle`
- `CommonTextStyle`
- others?


## Debugging Common UI

###### Console command: `CommonUI.DumpActivatableTree`

If you enter the above console command you will get an output log dump of debug information
that can be helpful to understand what the current Common UI display stack looks like.
